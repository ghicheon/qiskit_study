qiskit is very popular in quantum computing world. But I found out it's not easy to find a working code in qiskit as a beginner.
qiskit 1.2.x changed a lot. Therefore, as a newbie, I had a hard time to find a working code. There are so many code snippets out there though.
And I decided to write/collect working code for qiskit 1.2.x
