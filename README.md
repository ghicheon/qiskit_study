qiskit is very popular in quantum computing world. But I found out it's not easy to find a working code in qiskit as a beginner.
qiskit 1.2.x changed a lot. Therefore, as a newbie, I had a hard time to find a working code. There are so many code snippets out there though.
And I decided to write/collect working code for qiskit 1.2.x 


Reference:
There is no way to run the code on real quantum H/W  using previous version of 1.2.4  as far as I know. Becuase IBM doesn't give any chance to use it without qiskit_ibm_runtime. 
(Personelly, I don't think it's a good decision. backward compatibility should have been done :(    I wasted my time because of this.
If not, please let me know.)
